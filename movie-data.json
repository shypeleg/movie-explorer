There, the dashing prince falls in love with a white British clerk, Ruth Williams, and they plan to marry. While they suspect that his uncle, the Regent, would disapprove, nothing prepares them for the diplomatic firestorm and domestic political tumult their defiant love would spark. Now facing a citizenry leery of a white Briton as their Queen, the international opposition is even more unyielding from the British holding their land as a protectorate and fearful of South Africa's racist backlash to this affront to their apartheid domination. Against all odds, King Khama and Ruth must struggle to maintain their love and help their people in a land that would become the Republic of Botswana.","languages":"Tswana, English","country":"Czech Republic, UK, USA, France","awards":"1 win & 4 nominations.","poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDUyNzE1MTAxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU1Mzk5OTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"84%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"65/100"}],"metascore":"65","rating":"6.8","votes":"10,741","imdbid":"tt3387266","type":"movie","dvd":"06 Jun 2017","boxoffice":"$3,901,302","production":"Harbinger Pictures","website":"http://www.aunitedkingdomfilm.com/","response":"True","series":false,"imdburl":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3387266"}},null,{"fileName":"Chicken.People.2016.720p.WEB-DL.600MB.Ganool.ph.mkv","filePath":"/Volumes/Movies/New/Chicken.People.2016.720p.WEB-DL.600MB.Ganool.ph.mkv","searchableName":"Chicken People 2016","fileInfo":{"accessTime":"2018-08-24T23:31:52.000Z","modifiedTime":"2018-04-07T19:36:02.000Z","fileSizeMB":599.5708751678467},"searchEngineImdbLink":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118289/","imdbId":"tt0118289","imdbData":{"title":"Cow and Chicken","_year_data":"1995–1999","rated":"TV-PG","released":"1995-12-04T22:00:00.000Z","runtime":"30 min","genres":"Animation, Comedy, Family","director":"N/A","writer":"David Feiss","actors":"Charlie Adler, Candi Milo, Dee Bradley Baker, Michael Dorn","plot":"The program focuses on the misadventures of two unlikely yet somehow biological siblings: Cow and Chicken.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"Nominated for 2 Primetime Emmys.

Oliver is naturally a sullen man due to his growing up relationships with his parents (his mother who had a unique view on life) and watching his parents' cordial but somewhat distant relationship with each other, but is more so now because of his personal family losses. Oliver embarks on a relationship with Anna, a French actress, hoping that his re-energized relationship with Hal following Georgia's death, and Hal's new outlook on life during that time, will show Oliver how to act in a loving relationship. After Georgia's death, Hal came out of the closet and began to live with a joie de vivre that did not exist before, which included an open relationship with a much younger man named Andy. Oliver's relationship with Anna has other obstacles, including Anna's own vagabond lifestyle and Oliver needing to take care of who was originally Hal's very needy Jack Russell terrier, Arthur.","languages":"English, French","country":"USA","awards":"Won 1 Oscar.

Shortly after landing, she dies from complications while giving birth to the first human born on the red planet - never revealing who the father is. Thus begins the extraordinary life of Gardner Elliot - an inquisitive, highly intelligent boy who reaches the age of 16 having only met 14 people in his very unconventional upbringing. While searching for clues about his father, and the home planet he's never known, Gardner begins an online friendship with a street smart girl in Colorado named Tulsa. When he finally gets a chance to go to Earth, he's eager to experience all of the wonders he could only read about on Mars - from the most simple to the extraordinary. But once his explorations begin, scientists discover that Gardner's organs can't withstand Earth's atmosphere.

They go through the tunnel and find an abandoned amusement park on the other side, with its own little town. When her parents see a restaurant with great-smelling food but no staff, they decide to eat and pay later. However, Chihiro refuses to eat and decides to explore the theme park a bit more. She meets a boy named Haku who tells her that Chihiro and her parents are in danger, and they must leave immediately. She runs to the restaurant and finds that her parents have turned into pigs. In addition, the theme park turns out to be a town inhabited by demons, spirits, and evil gods. At the center of the town is a bathhouse where these creatures go to relax. The owner of the bathhouse is the evil witch Yubaba, who is intent on keeping all trespassers as captive workers, including Chihiro.
